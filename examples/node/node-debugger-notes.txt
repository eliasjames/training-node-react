Node Debugger

Two elements are necessary for debugging
- start a Node process running with flag for interactive mode
- connect to the debug process with a client (built-in or 3rd party)
- two different interactive modes
  - 'debug' (version 0 through 7)
  - 'inspect' (version 8+)

CLI client
- built-in client can either 
  - start the utility and connect to it, or
  - connect to a previously running instance
  - not a full-featured debugger, but simple step and inspection are possible
  - see more commands: https://nodejs.org/api/debugger.html
- version < 8
  - start and connect: 'node debug path/to/my-script.js'
  - connect to an existing process by its ID: 'node debug -p [PID]'
- version > 8
  - start and connect: 'node inspect path/to/my-script.js'
  - connect to an existing process not supported (use inspect, below)

Start a debugger process to connect CLI to
- 'node --debug path/to/my-script.js'
- starts process for connecting CLI debugger

Start an inspector process to connect other clients
- 'node --inspect path/to/my-script.js' (--inspect=9999 to specify port)
- console output varies by version but will always include a websocket (ws) protocol URI
- ...only=true&ws=127.0.0.1:9229/03827720-f0ea-4456-ae97-f3713f5e132f
- note 'ws' followed by address (including random string after port)
